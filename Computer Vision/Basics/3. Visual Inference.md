# Visual Inference - I

Being able to understand what is present in an image and where it is present.

- When moving objects into the feature space, the different classes should be seperable. Not relly linearly seperable
	- Maximal interclass variation
	- Minimal intraclass variation

### Traditional approaches of feature extraction

- Haar wavelets : Haar feature extractor
	- A sequence of scaled, square shaped signals that form an orthonormal basis
	- ![](haar.png)
	- ![](haar2.png)
	- It is a wave of unit duration
	- To extend it to larger duration there are two constraints
		- The area under the curve should be zero
		- Total area under the squares should be 1
		- Hence, if the frequency is increased, amplitude will decrease
	- n is modulating the size of wavelength and magnitude. 
	- k defines where the wavelet should sit. At 0 or at a shift

		- This shows the dot product of two wavelets
