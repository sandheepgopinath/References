##### Adjacency matrix
- Graph data is represented using Adjacency matrix

- It is symmetrical list of all nodes along row and columns. If two nodes are connected, corresponding position will be 1. Else it will be 0

##### Degree Matrix
Diagonal matrix which contains information about the degree of each node

##### Laplacian matrix

### Graph Neural Network

- Neural netrowk that operates on graph data structure
- Typical application - Node classification
- Every node is associated with a label
- GNNs are a hybrid of an information diffusion mechanism and neural networks that are used to process data, representing a set of transition functions and a set of output functions. The information diffusion mechanism is defined by nodes updating their states and exchanging information by passing “messages” to their neighboring nodes until they reach a stable equilibrium. The process involves first a transition function that takes as input the features of each node, the edge features of each node, the neighboring nodes’ state, and the neighboring nodes’ features and outputting the nodes’ new state

#### Applications
- Node classification : Determine the labelling of a node by examining the labels of immediate neighbours. Typically trained in semi supervised manner. 
-  Graph Classification : To classify the entire graph into different domains. Eg : Classifying if a protein is an enzyme etc, Categorizing documents in NLP
-   Graph Visualization : Visual representation of graph to reveal structures and anomallies
-   Link prediction : Comprehends the relation between nodes and forecasts the likehihood of the existance of a connection between two entities. Eg : Social media , recommeder system to determine criminal connections etc
-   Graph Clustering :Two types 
	- Vertex clustering : Groups together similar nodes based on the edge weights/edge distances. 
	- Graph clustering : Graphs are treated as objects and the object are clustered based on similarity. 
	
### Neighborhood Aggregation or Message Passing

It is the idea of gathering information about a node from it's neighbouring nodes. Neural networks gathers informatio about the edges of the node and preduct new set of embeddings for the node using a variety of techniques like Max pooling, averaging etc


Initial conifguration has the property xv. After message transmission

## Types of GNN

### Graph Convlutional Networks ( GCN )

Process of applying a spatially moving filter over the nodes of a graph that contains embeddings or data relevant to each node in order to obtain a feature representation of each node. . It is also possible to incorporate data from larger neighbourhood by stacking number of convolutional layers

The simplest GCN has only three different operators:

    Graph convolution
    Linear layer
    Nonlinear activation

In most cases, the operations are completed in this order. They work together to form a single network layer. In order to create a complete GCN, we can combine one or more layers.


### Graph AutoEncoders

When learning a compact representation of a graph, graph auto-encoders attempt to learn that representation and then re-construct the graph using the decoder. In order to learn graph embeddings, they can be used to predict embeddings for nodes that have not yet been observed as well as to classify newer nodes into existing categories within a graph, among other things.
