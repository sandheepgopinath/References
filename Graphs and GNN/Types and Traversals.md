# Types

- Graphs can be 
	- Hetrogeneous : Composed of different tyes of nodes
	- Homegeneous  : Composed of same type of nodes
	- Static : Nodes and edges do not chane, nothing is added or taken away
	- Dynamic : Nodes and Edges change, deleted, added, or moved
	- Dense : Many nodes and edges
	- Sparse : Fewerr nodes and edges

### Graph traversals

In directed graph, we would follow the direction of edges. 

- Walk : Closed walk when destination and source node are same
- Trail : Walk with no repeated edges - A circuit is a closed trail
- Path:  A walk with no repeated nodes - Cycle is a closed path
