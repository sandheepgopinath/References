# Neo4j Cypher Code

Syntax

### Cypher comments
- Comments start with // and putting text after slashes

### Representing nodes

### Node variables
To late refer the node we can give it a variable.
Eg: Match(p:Person)
here p is the variable

##### Example

()                  //anonymous node (no label or variable) can refer to any node in the database
(p:Person)          //using variable p and label Person
(:Technology)       //no variable, label Technology
(work:Company)      //using variable work and label Company

## Representing relationships in Cypher
- Relationships are represented in Cypher using an arrow --> or <-- between two nodes
- Undirected relationships are represented with no arrows and just two dashes.  --  This allows queries to be flexible.

	//data stored with this direction
	CREATE (p:Person)-[:LIKES]-&gt;(t:Technology)

	//query relationship backwards will not return results
	MATCH (p:Person)&lt;-[:LIKES]-(t:Technology)

	//better to query with undirected relationship unless sure of direction
	MATCH (p:Person)-[:LIKES]-(t:Technology)

	For example, let us look at the relationship types from our example graph.

    [:LIKES] - makes sense when we put nodes on either side of the relationship (Jennifer LIKES Graphs)

    [:IS_FRIENDS_WITH] - makes sense when we put nodes with it (Jennifer IS_FRIENDS_WITH Michael)

    [:WORKS_FOR] - makes sense with nodes (Jennifer WORKS_FOR Neo4j)
