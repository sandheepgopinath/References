	- Bankers look at working captial, basically everthing you can convert into cash into a short period of time. 
	-  The above number - short term liabiilities is the net working capital
	- Banker would look at ratio of debt and equity. If there is more debt than equity, then imoroving performance of company would improve the debt to equity ratio. 
	- Convertng a debt to equity can help improve debt to equity ratio
	- Balance sheet produced every month
	- Captitalization table will not change that often

## Capitalization table ( Should always be up to date)
- How you have raised money and who owns money
- Shows different classes of owner in your company
- **Cap table Contents**
	- Who owns the common stock - generally the founders/employees/advisors
	- Options - Reserve : Which will be issued to people. 
	- Warrants ?
	- Preferred stock : Preference over common stock. Having an advantage over common stock. They get the money first when the company is sold.
	- Convertible notes : A debt instument convertable to equity. We aren't sure how to price the value of company. When an invetor comes into company, the old investors will get the same preference as new investor.

## Cash Flow Statements
- Starts wwith net income 
	- Accounts receivable should have a threshold and should not go beyond that. 
	- Accounts payable should be balanced with the accounts receivable
- The net income accounted for accounts payable ad accounts receivable is the cash flow from operations. This would be different from net income

- Capital Expenditure is the next element. Equipments, Furniture etc
- Cash from financing activities.
