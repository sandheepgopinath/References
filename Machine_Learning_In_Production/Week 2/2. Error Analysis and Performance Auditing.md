# Error analysis and performance auditing

- Identify datapoints which are predicted wrong
- Identify different conditions which are common in them
- Error analysis is also an itertaive process
- Based on initial conditions identified, new tags can be identified and the data can be tagged again
- ![](error.png)

#### Metrics for each tag
- What fraction of errors has that tag?
- Of all data with that tag, what fraction is misclassified?
- What fraction of all daa has that tag?
- How much room for improvement , by using HLP ( Human Level Performance) on that tag

#### Prioritising what to work on
- ![](priority.png)
- Instead of looking at car noise as it is 4% away from HLP
- If we are able to do 1% better on clean speech, we wil be able to improve 0.6% rather than on Car noise which is only on 4% of the data
- Factors
	- How much room for improvement there is
	- How frequently that category appears
	- How easy it is to improve accuracy in that category
	- How important it is to impropve in that category
- How to?
	- Collect more data
	- Use augmentation to generate more data
	- Improve label accuracy/data quality
