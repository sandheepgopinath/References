# Understanding users

- Surveys : surveymonkey, googleforms, typeforms etc
	- Never ask for solutions
	- Be specific in questions
	- Textual responses are manageable in surveys of small size
	- Free form is better in certain cases
	- Yes / No type of questions would be good
	- Is Red / Green interface better
	- There can also be variations in ratings. ie, they are not normalized

- Observations : Observing participants in their natural settings without any intervention
	- It reflects the real environment
	- It may not be very deep
	- Howeer, it needs physical presence

- Probes : Alter the environment in some way and see how people react to it. 
	- Eg : Google Fibre was scaled out for free to understand the users change in behaviour

- Diary studies : Carry a diary and record incidents of interest

	- Open ended questions give more information
	- You can start with close ended questions to put the ubject at ease and then ask open ended questions
	- Talk to experts or users with different view points

The idea of probes and diary studies is interesting. Needs to be thought about.
