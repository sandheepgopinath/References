- Elements of Cognition
	- Attention
	- Perception, recognition
	- Memory
	- Learning
	- Language,reading, listening etc
	- Problem solving, decision making etc

## Perception

There are elements of perception which affects the user's experiece in interactig with something. It can be technologu, UI or any experiment.

- Example of perception for user interaction can be the influence of length of lines on road to reduce speed. Smaller lines gives the perception of higher speed. Hence people would slow down. 
- Mind games to stop deaths on tracks
- Progress bar for long operations


## Human Memory

- Reading : Memory, a contribution to experimental psychology
- Memory Types
	- Episodic vs Semantic
		- ABCD is episodic
	- Long term vs short term
	- Working memory vs muscle memory
		- Riding a bike. Muscle memory
	- Retrospective vs Perspective
	- Spatial( In space ) and Temporal ( In time)
	- Transactive
	- Recognition vs Recall ( Eg GUI vs Recall )
		- Prefer recognition whenever possible to make the interfaces simpler
	- Working Memory 
		- There should be fewer items for users to evaluate at the same time.
		- Most people can generally store 7 +-2 items in working memory
		- This has been taken to imply that menus should be about 7 or so items long
		- Eg 7 methods in a class. If there are more than 7, we can create around 7 clusters and each methods inside any of the clusters. 


# Cognitive biases is an important tool for critical thinking.  It is critical for objective decision making. It is used extensively by intelligence agencies like CIA. Be aware of your own biases and those of others.
