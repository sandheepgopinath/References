### The basic steps

- Create setup instructions 
- Give written task list
- Explain that you are testing the interface, not them
- Explain that you are not going to provide help
- Debrief : General questions about what did they think, considerations etc
- Comparison is a great tool
- The design of interfaces for surveys and getting user feedback are really important as they can bias or confuse the user thus giving a wrong feedback. 


### Between and within subjects
- Between : Different subjects try different conditions
- Within : Each user tries both

### Copy editing
- Proof read every word
- Get copy checked by proof reader
- Analyze subtle connotations ( 'allow ' vs 'enable')

### Error message guideline
- Be explicit
- Human readable and described over phone
- Polite ( not 'illegal action')
- Precise ( Add more details about why the error )
- Constructive ( give users something to do )
- Preserve existing work
- Reduce the work of correcting the error
- Build a custom 404 /500 page
- Educate users and improve the user's mental model : ( This operation is allowed only in this specific mode etc )


### Punctuation rules
- semicolon connects independent clauses
- Colon : Second clause explains the first 
- Hyphen : separates two connected words
- En-dash : indicates a range
- Em-dash : separates clauses, emphasizes the second
- Space after a stop
