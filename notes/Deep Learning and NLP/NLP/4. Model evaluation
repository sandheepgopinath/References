# Model evaluation

Once a model is created, and let's say it has produced predictions. How do you quantify the prediction to say which ones are more natural?


- Intrinstic evalution : A meaasure of how good the model is with respect to its defined functioality.
	- Information entropy is one measure that is used to define this.

	- Cross Entropy

	- yi hat is the training corpus
	- yi is the test corpus
	- Cross entropy usually is higher than the Information entropy
	- Zipf law and Universality of Zipf law
	- Power law

- Extrinsic evaluation : Use the model to solve task. Easier to understand the concept.
	Eg : A speech recognition system can be used to test if a text generation is working fine.
