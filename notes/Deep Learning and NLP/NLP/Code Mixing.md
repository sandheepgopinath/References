# Multilingual society

- A society or group where all / most of the people speak multiple languages

# Code-Mixing
- Happens in all multilingual societies
- Is predominantly a spoken language phenomenon
- Is generally associated with informal conversations
- It happens a lot of Social media as people talk / chat informally ( A good source of data )
- Data drawn from multilingual society can be skewed if we select only selected languages. Eg : If we take only English reviews, and if they are all positive, it might not be true. Because all negative comments might be in Hindi
