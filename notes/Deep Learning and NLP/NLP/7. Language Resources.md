Resource distribution
- The data distribution is skewed and we do not have a lot of labeled data
- Labeled data will be available in smaller quantity which can be used for testing and the unlabeled data can be used for training

	- The languages which get benefited by Zero Shot Learning are the languages which has large unlabeled data and little labeled data
	- Class 1 does not have labeled data for testing
	- Class 5 do not need Zero Shot as they have lot of labeled data

##### Properties of datasets
![[Pasted image 20220322112115.png]]
- Expected size of data is important
- Format of data : Json? Is metadata informative enough??
- Quality of data is very important. There are languages which have data, but they are not of right quality. 
	- Quality can be for content, size, veracity, correctness
#### The 4 P's of data collection
Privacy is really important when we generate data. Eg : Ownership , Copyright etc
- PII : Personal Identification Information

Methods to get data
- Pay 
	- Can use crowd sourcing websites
	-  Control : Hire annotators and pay them to annotate data
- Pray :
	- Creating community resources
	- Asking people to contribute
- Play : 
	- Games with a purpose
	- Eg : ESP where games were used to get images labeled
	- Unless it become popular, we get very little data
- Pry :
	- Re-purposing data
		- Data collected for something else which can be used for our training


#### Error's during annotation
- Conceptual Errors : 
	- Bias can cause errors. Eg Political sentiments etc
	- Under specified annotation guideline
	- Hard cases
- Typographical Errors:
	- Slip of finger
	- Slip of mind


To avoid error's data has to be 
- annotated by multiple number of people and checking if they fall in same clusters
-  Manual evaluation
-  Random sampling
-
