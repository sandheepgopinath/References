# 4.Sentence Parsing

- To understand the meaning of a sentence, we have to understand the context. 
- For which we can use POS tagging
- Eg : I saw a monkey and I used a saw to cut a log of wood
  - Saw in first sentence is a verb wheras in second sentence it is an object

- Common rules
  - Usually every sentence has a noun followed a verb phrase
  - Verb phase has a verb followed by a noun phrase
  - A noun phrase can end with a 'noun' or a 'pronoun'
  - Noun phrase has a determinant followed by a noun
  - Determinant can be "a" or "the"

 
- Sentence analysis is done to parse a sentence into different POST components
