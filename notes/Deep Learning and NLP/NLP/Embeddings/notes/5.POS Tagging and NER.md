# 5.POS Tagging and NER

## POS Tagging
  
- Helps to avoid mistakes of syntax
- Regex does not work for POS tagging due to huge variations in language
- Examples :

- Humans have higher accuracy with unstructred data and lower accuracy with structured data. 
- In the case of natural language processing, RNN are used more recently to generate POS tags based on the word and its context. 
- Prediction of POS tag of a words based on its position in a sentence similar to CBOW
- Prediction of POS tag based on the POS tags of its neighbors

Exception example :
- I saw a man on the hill with a telescope
  - I saw the man. He was on the hill. I was using a telescope
  - I saw the main. I was on the hill. I was using a telescope
  - I saw the main. The main was on the hill. The hill had a telescope. 
  - I saw the man. I was on the hill. The hill had a telescope
  - I saw the main. The man was on the hill. I saw him using a telescope. 



  ## Named Entity Recognition
- Mapping to Entitied in a tagged corpus
- Rule based by checking Capitalization
- RNN to learn based on corpus
