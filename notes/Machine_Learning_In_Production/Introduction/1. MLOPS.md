# Machine Learning Operations ( MLOps)- 
1. Data Engineering : Someone who enables or brings data in proper way for data scientists
	- Enables data
	- Data ingest 
	- Maintaining schemas
	- Data Pipelines
	- Data Lake/ Warehouse
---
2. Software Engineering 
	- Development ( API's etc)
	- Reliable deployments
	- Tests ( Codes are usually not tested as much as it is done for normal software projects)
		- Testing the model/ algorithms under different conditions. ( Eg Edge cases )
			- Unit test
			- Integration test
			- Smoke test etc
			- Testing of features 
			- Testing of datasets
	- Integration with other systems
	- Libraries and packaging
---
3. Data Science 
	- Data Understanding(EDA)
	- Statistical Modelling
	- ML / DL
	- Train / Test Models
