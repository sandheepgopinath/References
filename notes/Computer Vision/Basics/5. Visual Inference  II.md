#### Keypoint based feature extraction for image matching

For Keypoint identification : 
- The images should be visually distinguishable
- Given a path, we should be able to identify where it came from and it should be unique
- Easy to identify

For feature extraction:
- Should not change if the images scale changes
- Looking at the image from different pose should not change the features
- Should be rotation, illumination and location invariant. 


### SIFT : Scale Invariant feature transform
 a)  Key point identification
 
  If the features remain the same as we change the scale, then that feature is said to be a stable one.

  - When scaling it down, here we are taking a sigma of $s^(1/4)$
  - Everytime when we apply the above Gaussian mask, the image gets blurred. Also at the same time, we loose some information. 
  - When we repeat the process 4 times with sigma = $s^(1/4)$, the effective sigma becomes equal to $2$ .
  - It is equivalent to scaling or reducing the size of image. 
  - So to reduce the computational complexity, we do the further operations on a smaller image which is equivalent to doing the Gaussian 5 times. 
  - If a feature remains consistent throughout the stages, that is identified as a prominent feature.
