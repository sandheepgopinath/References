Fourier Transform

-  Fourier Series - ??

- Fourier Transform - ??




- Sinusoids can be represented as exponential
- Exponential is a simplest way of representing Cos0+ i Sin0

- ki and lj are the frequanecy of two sinusoidal or cosiodal waves. 
- Varying ki and lj helps to get a wave which lies along the dialgonal of x and y axis
- kj is a wave along x axis
- lj is a wave along y axis
- Hence combining them gives a wave along the diagonal

### Correlation
- Shows how two values are related
- Value between 0 and 1


## Covariance
- How are the variance of two datasets related



# Dirac Delta function
- Unit impulse function which is infinity at 0 and 0 at all other points.
- Non physical and singlarity( Something from goes from 0 to infinity suddently)

##### Unit Pulse


- This is approximated using **Unit Pulses**
- Area under curve of Unit pulse function is 1
- ![](metrics.png)
- It can be any signal as long as the area under the curve is 1

##### Sifting property

- Integrating dirac with function would give the value of the signal at the point the dirac function is fired. If the area under the curve is 1, it does not change the vaule during integration, as integration gives the area under the curve. 


## Convolution

- Linear Time invariant system
- ![](https://www.probabilitycourse.com/images/chapter10/LTI.png)
- A continous signal will have infinite points.
- Hence they are converted to digital signals
