Problem Statement:
- Create a text analysis service for an enterprise
- This service should allow you to perform different types of text analysis in enterprise data like - sentiment and opinion mining
- The service will integrate with external apps - mobile App, web apps and back end systems. 



### System design

- Since it has to be used by multiple applications, it would be ideal to implement it as a REST API. 
- We can send the text and action as input and return the result
- The text will be sent to a Text Analysis model which can process the data and prepare the results
- Identify the right tools which can be used for these applications

- For text services  we can use three options
	- Virtual Machines EC2
		- If you need OS level controls and if the service is running almost always
		-  Micro services are best implemented here
	- Docker ECS
		- Longer running process and if you need environment flexibility
		- Docker containers are completely isolated from OS. It will not affect the other services on the server. 
		- We can have multiple instances of docker which runs the same service. 
		- Kubernetes cluster can be used to scale this automatically
	- Serverless Lambda
		- If you have smaller service which runs for less than 15 mins
		- It will automatically scale based on loads
		- They have lesser memory and RAM's

	- ### API 
	
	- AWS Gateway API
		- Auto scalable and no code way to expose service
		
	- Custom REST API using
		- EC2 
		- Docker

### Steps to implementation
1. Setup environment
	1. 
2. Implement an NLP model using Textblob - extract sentiment from text
3. Warp model into lambda function
