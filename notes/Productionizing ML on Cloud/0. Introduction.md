 - Cloud basics - Infrastructure
 	- Compute :  Servers and Container services
- Storage
	- Files, relational databases, NoSQL
- Network
	- Internet, LAN and VPN
- PaaS Services
	- Queues, Managed DB, Lambda Functions, Email, Notifications etc
	- By using lambda functions, we do not have to be worried about underlying OS, scaling or anything. They have some restriction about the amount of compute, RAM and length of process
	- 5-10 min process, it is recommended. Greater than that, Virtual machines or other services are better
