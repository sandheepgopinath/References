**Originality :** 

- Originality need not be always something which is new. It can be derived out of something which is Pre-existing.
- It can also be based on perspectives. Something which is original for someone might not be original for someone else.
- It can be something related to a personality or something genuine and not artificial.

Nothing is new. It is a new combination of things that are not new.

#### Summary
Every person has their own experiences , takeaways , learning and their own interpretation of whatever has happened with their life or has observed happening around them . It is this combination of that makes everyone unique.  

While writing it is not important to focus on writing something which was never written before, because there is nothing as such. Rather, it is important to write content which reflect who you are. This can be done by identifying the topic you want to write about, think and reflect about it to understand it from you perspective and then express it in your style. This can give rise to unique content

## Process of writing
Issues which people usually face while writing
- Lots of thoughts can lead to lack of quality /completion
- Order of thoughts is important
	- Bullet points can be in any order
- Lack of narrative continuity is a common problem
- Lot of information is assumed
- Do they have to take a side or not?
- Thinking of the problem or solution as binary. 
	- Eg : Is gogogle making us stupid?
    	<br>Hee, It is assumed to be a Yes/ No answer. 
        
- If there are no right r wring answers, It is a prompt
- Sticking with a thought without jumping from thought to thought can evantually lead to something
