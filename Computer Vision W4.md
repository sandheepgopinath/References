# Computer Vision Week 4


- Object Classification
- Object Detection
- Precision and Recall
- Intersection over union
- Mean Average Precision

## Open CV , CustomVision and Lobe
- [Open CV Image Processing approaches discussed](https://github.com/sandheepgopinath/Code-Repository/tree/main/Computer-Vision/Opencv/Basic%20Image%20Processing)

- OpenCV shall be used whenever possible and can help to reduice the complexity of certain problems without using Deep Learning Models
- If not possible by Basic Image Processing Libraries or OpenCV, try Deep Learning
- [Create the models using CustomVision.ai automcatically](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/)
- The trained models can be downloaded in Tensorflow/ Tensorflow lite format
- Might need to make some minor tweaks to change the threshold accuracy, maximum number of objects detected in a single frame etc, based on your use case
- [Lobe.ai is another wonderful solution acquired by Microsoft](https://www.lobe.ai/)
- However, the usage of lobe may be restricted in certain use cases. Usually with Binary predictions/ classifications.
