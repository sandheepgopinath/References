### Human problem solving and Cognition

- Reading : How to solve it : G. Polya

#### Cognition
- To understand what process might be going on in a users mind, how users think, what might make them more or less efficient etc

Elements of Cognition
- Attention
- Perception
- Recognition
- Memory
- Learning
- Language, reading , listening etc
- Problem Solving, Decision maaking

#### Perception
- Gestault Philosophy : We see what we perceive
- Perceptions are resistant to change
	- Perception fixation
		- Brunner porter experiment : We tend to have a perception fixation with the first thing we see and we try to find reasoning for proving that. It will take time to overcome this perception fixation

	- Perceiving incongruities
		- Bruner - Postman experiment with playing cards

#### Stroop testing
- To check interference

## Implications
- Be predicatable and consistent throughout the design
- Applies to interface elements like color,fonts,sounds,etc
- Otherwise leads to higher cognitive load and more time to process
- Develop and stick to "brand" guidelines
- Avoid cognitive dissonance
- Make information salient when needed
- Can use animation/grapics/color/font/decorations/ordering/spacing etc to draw attention
- Avoid clutter and prefer simple interfaces
- Consider sompetition for attention
- Test to see what draws attention
- Multi-tasking has an impact on attention
- 

### High Level interaction models
Given an interface, can we predict user performance on some task using a high level cognitiive model?
This may tell us which interface might be better at task without having to build its details. 


#### It is important to understand where a users attention move to, on seeing something immediately and interfaces has to be designed keeping this in mind.
